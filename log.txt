Cool challenge, intially made a wrong assumption about how to do it but got it
easily in the end.

tainted because I looked at the writeup before, so I decided to skip

Took a huge break because of vacations + work + laziness. This was fun because
it was a simple bug, but a bit difficult to exploit. A nice way to get back to

Another break due to defcon/etc. Maybe I'll put some writeups of what I did at
DEFCON up at some point but for now back to generic pwnables.
